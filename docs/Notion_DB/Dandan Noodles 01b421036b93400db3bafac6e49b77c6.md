Description: A quick, simple recipe for Dandan noodles that can be prepared with any preferred noodle.

### Ingredients

- Any noodle (works really well with spicy-flavoured instant noodles e.g. IndoMie)
- 2-4 cloves of garlic
- 2 stalks of spring onions
- Sesame seeds (add as much as preferred)
- Chilli flakes
- Chilli powder (only if instant noodles doesn't come with chilli powder)
- Sichuan pepper (or just normal ground black/white pepper if not available)
- Brown sugar
- Soya sauce
- Peanut butter
- Oil

### Instructions

1. Roughly chop 2-4 cloves of garlic and 2 stalks of spring onions. Place aside into a glass or heat-proof bowl. 
2. Take seasoning and chilli powder from the instant noodle packet and add into the bowl.
3. Add as much or as little sesame seeds as preferred.
4. Add chilli flakes for more heat. 
5. In a small pan, cover the bottom of the pan with oil and heat on a low-medium fire. 
6. Boil water and once boiled, submerge noodles and leave to cook. Stir the noodles once with chopsticks to separate them. 
7. To check if the oil is hot enough, touch the noodles to the bottom of the pan. If the chopsticks sizzle on contact then the oil is ready. If no sound is heard then the oil will be ready when the oil begins to bubble around the chopsticks. 
8. Turn off the stove and pour the oil over the mixture in the glass bowl. Using a spoon quickly mix all the ingredients. 
9. Add one spoon of soya sauce, one spoon of brown sugar and one spoon of peanut butter. Thoroughly stir this mixture again. 
10. Drain the noodles, but pour a little noodle water into the glass bowl and stir this mixture again. 
11. Once the noodles are drained and the sauce is properly mixed, pour the sauce over the noodles and mix until evenly covered.
