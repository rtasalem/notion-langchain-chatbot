## Ingredients

- Sushi rice
- Japanese rice vinegar (or Mirin if not available)
- Brown sugar
- Salt

## Instructions

### Sushi Rice Preparation

1. Wash 250g of rice with cold water, stirring in a circle by hand. Drain and repeat until water runs clear. 
2. Soak the washed rice in cold water for 15-30 minutes before draining thoroughly. This allows the rice to absorb water right to the centre of each grain for even cooking. Add in 330ml of cold water and cook rice. 
3. Once cooked add seasoning and allow to cool. 

### Sushi Rice Seasoning

1. Mix 3 tbsp of Japanese rice vinegar (or Mirin) with 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp salt.
2. Pour into cooked sushi rice and mix well until rice is evenly coated.
